          <h3>Dating app for game characters</h3>
          <p>
            We were given the task of developing a dating app for fictional characters with peculiar gimmicks during a 30 minute concepting workshop. Despite the fact that our group was new, we quickly became close by assigning tasks and selecting entertaining, well known characters. 
            I took the initiative to assign tasks and provide feedback on the Figma pages, contributed ideas, and proposed Bowser as a component of the main idea. I was also in charge of the presentation; I wrote a brief script with a catchphrase that Dirk approved.

          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>In this short time frame i did feel under pressure but this mini project also made me realise that i had to collaborate with people i have never 
            worked with before and make sure the concept is presented. I was ready to take the challenge and learnt concepting in such a short time.</p>

          <h3>Catchee logo moodboard & stylescapes</h3>
          <p>
            To turn our group into a real agency, we created a 
            brand logo and identity. I helped brainstorm shared 
            interests and values, which led to a clear brand identity.
             I also made a moodboard to explore the visual direction.
              After a group vote, I created a stylescape using Michelle's 
              cat doodles to stay true to the concept. I actively 
              contributed to shaping the agency identity, with 
              core values defined as bold, creative, and curious. 
              This is where Catchee began, though it was not yet named. 
              I also sketched potential logo ideas based on cat themes 
              and the core values.

          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p>Everyone had the task to start ideating and concepting the moodboards and stylescapes. We voted and sticked to 
            one. From there I sketched and created a lot of my own ideas of the possible catchee logo's. I got a lot of reactions on these from 
            my group mates. Erem also took inspo from one of sketches to try and recreate it. The group picked the latter version and eventually 
            there was a last vote in what logo we prefered. Here Catchee's logo continued.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="proof">
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>Despite my various attempts of getting voted in both the logo sketches and moodboards concepting, 
            I did find it very satisfying to see where we started off with the logo and which one eventually was picked.
            Also i find it beautiful that my concept was also recreated to anothers concept. It changes perspectives quickly and keeps you learning.</p>

          <h3>Catchee branding development</h3>
          <p>Now was time to give shape to the brand. Out of the moodboards, stylescapes and core values we also had to make sure how we showcase the concepting of branding. My task was to help adding ideas to the list and figuring out our proper associations, mission, vision and slogan. But also when it came to the voted logo design I helped deciding what exact colors and typography could represent the brand. I also came up with the tone of voice of catchee and pitched it to the group.</p>

             devided among the group. What I did was the brand

             on how to fix it style wise, so that the design of

          <p>I partcipated in writing out ideas 
            and brainstorming for the concepting 
            part in figma jam. We formed different 
            brainstorm boards in which all of us added
             some notes. I added a shuffle card idea
              / a partnered bingo / mascot pop up. 
              All the notes were devided into cluster
               groups to themes and UX/UI hierarchy 
               to form a better idea on to setting the priorities to this project. Despite all this I placed votes on the ideas of others, since I felt this matched the core values too. Here you can see my notes on figjam.</p>

          <h3>Pirate theme for speedmeet</h3>
          <p>When creating concept from catchee designs agency for our clients speedmeet game, I wanted to create something the audience would find entertaining and sort of adventurous. To me what spoke to me was pirates. This was Michelles concept word but I merged myself into it as well, I wanted to create my own idea of it.</p>
          <a href="images/pirate1.JPG" target="_blank"> pirate sketch concept 1</a><br>
          <a href="images/pirate2.JPG" target="_blank"> pirate sketch concept 2</a><br>

          
          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p>My concept was simply sketched where I kind of give it all a story; All players are in groups of 2 in a boat as pirates (or pirate cats) and cross the ocean through different islands (stages) where they find treasure chests with questions to answer. And it goes on till the last round where they find similarities in each other and get called a certain pirate name plus personality trait. It got voted out compared to the other concept ideas in the group mainly for the "overcomplicated code for game under a specific timeframe" reason.</p>

        <div class="proof">
          <h3>Timer for speedmeet</h3>
          <p>I had the task to make a timer on figma for catchee. Now there are various ways you can think of creating when keeping the word "timer" in mind. A digital / traditional clock, maybe a hourglass?</p>
          
          
          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p>I went firstly with exploring timers on most websites and how the figma experts on youtube tend to do it. This was a digital timer where you see the numbers change every second or minute passing by. I practiced a bit on figma by following the tutorials and failed multiple times, especially since when I had to test the prototype the numbers never alligned on time. This eventually turned into what you can see here. You can see the rest of the timer process in LO 3. If you play this video you can see what the final result looked like.</p>

          <h3>Background phone screen speedmeet</h3>
          <p>I was given the task to ideate and create a background that does not distract the potential users from playing the game, yet ads the cozy sunset campfire vibe with the Cat players.</p>

          <a href="images/scr2.mov" target="_blank"> screenrecording timer after</a><br>

          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p>For this I took inspo from studio ghibli and their cozy nature scenes like this one. This was a bit tough to imagine but I already had in mind that I would want the background to get the blurred effect no matter how detailed I am making the background at the moment on the ipad. I don't tend to do digital drawings but I intended on sketching the idea first so I can ask the rest if I should go on with it or not. The feedback I got from the majority was that I had taken the task too seriously and should try to zoom in to the picture rather than give a whole scenery. This was relating the concepting, the rest of the progress is to be seen in LO3. But you can see the final result of my work in the background on a example screen here:</p>

          <h3>Creating feedback questions speedmeet</h3>
          <p>Me and Eline had the task to partner up and brainstorm questions for the partcipants of speedmeet. This is for them to fill out after the entire rounds and getting to know eachother a lot better. With the help of these questions we get proper feedback from live and active partcipants that play this and witness this for the first time. The idea is that the questions shouldn't be too time consuming and therefore boring for the user so we came up with these quetsions.</p>
          <a href="pdf/Questionaire.pdf" target="_blank"> View concept presentation pptx</a> <br>
          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p>Starting off when coming up with questions, the main idea was to try the method with HMW questions. This helped
            us formulate the entire question structure for the main questioons for during the event. After that I formulated my own 
            questions based on what was crucial to know and work on as feedback bases for the participants after playing the rounds.
            I let this be checked by the group members and teachers. It worked out and they were printed in a manner that it was an a6 
            size paper feedback form. Not only does it give the impact that it is small and easy to complete but also has enough space 
            for extra commentary which was at some point well used.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="proof">
          <h4>What could go better?</h4>
          <p>Looking back, I could improve by managing my time and scope more realistically, as some of my ideas were too much for the given timeframe or technical limitations. In order to translate ideas into functional solutions more easily, I also want to gain more confidence in my technical fields using tools like Figma, when prototyping interactions.</p>

          <h3>Microsoft team / Whatsapp / discord</h3>
          <p>I used Teams and a big amount of Whatsapp to communicate and share updates, Trello to keep track of tasks, and OneDrive to store our files. It wasn't anything fancy, but it worked really well. Discord also had a role in the collaboration tool department. Having everything in one place and good communication on Teams made it easier to stay organized and avoid mix-ups. When working on the project, I stored design data on figma too to have an overview on the work and look at the teams work in figma too.</p>
          
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>Using these apps/ tools in my opinion help everyday communication withon the team and keep us a lot more on track with storing our files and data. 
            When communicating with my team outside of college hours would be needed i didnt find myself struggling with this at all. So i would use these in the future too alongside

            Especially helped to prove at latecomings/absents when one didnt remember the consequences at some point. Team charters always should be a must when

          <h4>Meeting 1</h4>
          <p>In order to establish project objectives, specifications, and limitations SpeedMeet held its first client meeting. The target audience consists of people between the ages of 18 and 22 who suffer from social anxiety or loneliness. Feedback indicates that there should be no video content because of privacy concerns and that the icebreakers should be easy and entertaining. To keep the experience fun and stress free, the client prefers a primarily digital solution, preferably an app with inventive features like avatars, playful timers, digital chat cards, or augmented reality.</p>
          
          <h4>Meeting 2</h4>
          <p>Three game concepts; a whimsical lakeside frog theme, a fun beach picnic, and a comfortable campfire setting with marshmallow based timers were presented to the client during this meeting in order to get their input and determine a clear course of action. The client liked the ridiculousness of the frog concept, but she preferred the campfire idea because of its cozy, cozy setting, with the marshmallow timer and natural surroundings being its main advantages. She also suggested adding roughly five more icebreakers, as long as they are usertested prior to the event, and agreed that it was crucial to make it clear to players that each round lasts ten minutes.</p>
          
          <h4>Meeting 3</h4>
          <p>During this meeting, we presented our finalized game concept and design choices, which included a fish-on-a-stick visual timer, a QR-code poster to reduce screen time, and customizable cats in a natural setting. In addition to confirming that there will be six tables rather than ten, approving the use of a speaker if audio is required, and responding favorably to the concept posters, the client gave insightful feedback on accessibility, logistics, and facilitation. They also planned to share the posters with the JoinUs organizer.</p>
          
          <h4>Meeting 4</h4>
          <p>We presented the client with our updated user-testing and prototyping strategy during this meeting, suggesting a Wizard of Oz approach that would use 12 phones and printed stickers to show customization because of time constraints. The client gave their approval to the plan, examined the new icebreakers, and provided helpful input on player setup. They also explained the prototype in detail, solicited feedback, actively invited participants, and took into account other event logistics like timing and sound.</p>
          
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>Of course since i was the spokesperson with the client i knew i had to take the meetings more into account since i will be sending and receiving more information of what we spoke in the meetings. 
            I remained to be in the meetings and since this is the main time to pay attention and make sure you ask the right questiosns. Here ive built understanding and communication with the client and the team. 
          The meeting days were also decided beforehand and gave us enough time to work on our internal deadlines.</p>

          <p>I served as our client's point of contact, answering emails regarding scheduling, inquiries, and progress reports both before and after meetings and sharing all answers with the group. In order to arrange logistics like setup, location, and scheduling, I was also in charge of corresponding with Nikki via email and in person during the event.</p>

          <h3>Creating script and manual for speedmeet</h3>
          <p>Eline and I had to create the the script and manual for the speedmeet users. This is for the process of the game to go smoothly. Think of a sort of guide to start the game. All the information for what tools the user need is in the manual and what will be said is in the script (storytelling).</p>

          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p>We devided the tasks: I would do manual and she would do script and after that we go through eachothers work, give feedback, add change where needed and discuss this with group. Pretty solid but in a way I did ended up working on both. I made the entire manual in the beginning where the user can see what all is needed to make sure the game takes place. Think about audio; screens; chairs and tables etc. I explained how many we need and why. I didn't get feedback to fix much on mine since it was reasonable but I did help eline's script since my (and the groups) feedback was that this was too long. We cut it short together but in a way it is still too long. As a group it was descided that we will do an improv on the speedmeet event when it came to script since this will be too much to memeorize.</p>
          
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>Since task was in duos and could give/receive feedback i did try my best to image how my manual could help explain a user fully what they would need to complete their game setup and have a smooth time hosting it.</p>

          <h3>Event planning: my role</h3>
          <p>The group sat togetehr and made an event planning document for the event coming up soon, in which I also participated in. Mind you, this 
            document is to help, if host(s) is stuck or doesnt know what to do mid game, a manual to see who does what before, during and after the game.</p>
                   <a href="pdf/Event Planning.docx" target="_blank"> view planning</a> <br>
          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p>The roles were decided among us and I also wrote what exactly my responsibilities were that come within the role. My role was person E: the recruiter and phone lookout. Pretty simple: before the game starts I actively recruit people with all excitement around the hall who are willing to participate in the game. During the game: Walk around and watch the phone testings of the users playing. After the game: Help direct flow to feedback table. The first and last role are extremely important since without active recruiting particpants there wouldn't be enough people to play and directing feedback to the table later on helped erem feedback formulation doc.
              This was later also practiced while usertesting the entire game and roles</p>
          
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>Since i did agree on my role and looked back properly what i was in charge of i also wanted to have a proper look at the rest of the teams tasks and roles. 
            This later on helped me at the event because of how some plans did not go accordingly at the event itself. So i did manage to do an improv with the help of just using this doc properly. 
          It worked as a clear instruction and guide for me to take part with the roles of the host and partly the others roles when needed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="proof">
          <h4>What could go better?</h4>
          <p>Definetly, speaking for after the event: we shouldve maybe usertested this script on a bigger group with the same environment of the event hall
            by actually experiencing and presenting during some background noises and with/without the equipment. At some point I do think having an option B incase 
            some errors happening is a thing I would add to the listen next time.</p>

          <h3>Stylescape iterations</h3>
          <p>Before we started on anything relating our agency we ahd to make moodboards and stylescapes. 
            Mine needed a lot of iterating but eventually got chosen since i took out more inspo out of 
            succesful companies' stylescapes.</p>
            <a href="images/stylescape1.png" target="_blank"> iteration stylescape</a><br>

          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p>When starting with my stylescape i took my moodboard as an inspo and kept looking around on what companies like 
            nintendo; cocacola; mc donalds etc. Like what structure/style do they follow that makes it so wow. i treid follwoing the sme concept
          in a way but more oriented on what my moodboard already cocnsisted of. Added some humor some color some random stuff which matched the core values.
          <br><br>
          But then i got feedback. Mygroup was really liking it but they told me that the colors seem to be a bit dull and to probably take inspo from companies that 
          also have for example BOLD as their core value with highly contrasting color palettes. I agreed, looked around, played with teh palettes and guess what i made the previous 
          blues and orange less dark. eevrything bright and opposite. Evenetually i also added michelles doodles and some cat paws. Got rid of the funny stuff (horses) and then there it was.</p>
          
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>I do feel like i shouldve put research (even though these are just images online) and inspos in the pinterest since just i have no link to source back to.
            Here i did miss the chance to show what i looked at first when starting the moodboard/stylescapes and then later after iterating on the feedback given to me. 
            I will include these minor details for the next time.</p>

          <h3>Branding logo design iterations</h3>
          <p>coming up with a logo is harder than you think especially if its for your own agency.
             Here i show you what were the steps i took to get to the final result.</p>
          <a href="images/corevalues.jpg" target="_blank"> core values catchee</a><br>
          <a href="images/logosketch.jpg" target="_blank"> logo sketching</a><br>

          <a href="images/mergedlogovote.jpg" target="_blank"> logo voting</a><br>
          
          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p>It all started off basic with my pencil and paper. At times i would have pinterest open to glance at cat related logos
            or look for cat related icons that could give me in a way some sort of idea to merge 1 on 1 and create something that would look and 
            feel like catchee. I also had to make sure i consider looking at the branding socument with the core values; mission and vission, to explain
            my choices. Here i made about roughly 15 sketches on logo ideas, where some of them were just icons others were plain name of brand. Others a mix.
            We asked around in the class to see which most people preffered and got closer to our logo choice.
          <br><br>
            overall i did get a lot of attention from my team from this one flying cat under the name catchee where the C is basically a cat tail. It is important to mention
            Erem had taken this as inspo and put some of his creativity to it too. I am glad he did cuz my original got voted out. From there i gave him feedback on this specific one 
            where he merged his "paw" sketch with my logo idea which then made it in the top 3.
            to vote.</p>
          
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>Overall tough work. It is of course not easy to make a logo but since we started off with so many ideas 
            i did know it was going towards a really good direction. Mixing and merging and testing and choosing and voting. 
            From 100 ideas to one final answer. I think the process was definietly fun. Finding out what people prefer and figuring out the why's and how's.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="proof">
          <h3>Branding guide design</h3>
          <p>My task here was to explain the roles of the colors for catchee. The rules, the names and hex codes etc. You can see what it looked like here before any feedback:</p>
          <a href="images/brandguide1.png" target="_blank"> brandguide before</a><br>
            <a href="images/brandguide2.png" target="_blank"> brandguide after</a><br>

            <a href="pdf/Branding.docx" target="_blank"> View branding document</a> <br>
          
          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p>In the start all the pages were devided into sections based of on who willd o what pages of the brand guide. Since this was happeening 
            everyone had their own version of design ideas and this was not looking consistent together. We then decided to use my stylescape as a color palette 
          for the main catchee brandguide inspo.<br><br>I was given feedback on my part group was that it looked too old and simple, dynamic was missing, so therefore 
          making the circle into another form ( So I turned them into paint blobs) and the colors had to pop out more so don't keep your colors limited to the page 
          (I added a mix of blacks oranges and whites to all pages with hints of blue). Again, this was mainly based on my stylescape. When the pages were put together 
          it looked like one whole piece and not seperate puzzels.</p>
          
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>Gneerally speaking i find brandguides pretty simple to make. With my team there was some miscommunication in the start but after that we stayed consistent on the design choice.
            I agreed with the feedback i had received from the group and the iterated version turned out a lot better.</p>

          <h3>Business cards catchee w iterations</h3>
          <p>So, I came up with the idea to have business cards for the agency. #professionalvibes</p>
          <a href="images/businesscard.png" target="_blank"> business cards ss</a><br>
            <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/vbuWswESohyTvNHe8oKSdY/S3-Project-2.0?node-id=11-2&p=f&t=VkwGRx7ywqrOopbH-0" target="_blank">View Figma</a> <br>
          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p>I wanted to make a digital product for catchee to give more of that agency feeling so i created a business card. I took inspo from pinterest and starting creating adding the brandguide vibe to it. 
            There was a visison since The bold colors and playfulness of 
            the paint drops make it look creatively professional. I had feedback from the team where i iterated on and made the final design for the card:
           <br><br>The feedback in the start was that I had the logo really big for the back of the card and to make it smaller with a quote in the middle. 
           As you can see I did that but then later the colors felt too offputting and they wanted more pop of freshness, so I experimented and played around 
           with the white paintblobs that were also used in the brand guide for colors. I got positive reactons towards this design from my group members.</p>
          
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>Very smooth process and satisfying to see the end results so quick. I'm glad this served as an extra design product i thought of 
            especially since i felt, if we were to give ourselves out on a card how would it look. And thats that. I will definetly focus on more add ons 
            like this one in the near future.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="proof">
          <h3>Figma iteration poster</h3>
          <p>I hadnt made the entire poster but made part of it into iteration. Specifically the main poster all the way down at the team members section. I felt that where Erem left it at, seemed a bit too much, so I wanted to help adding my own feedback into his poster. This was Erem's at first:</p>
                 <a href="images/postererem.png" target="_blank"> erems poster for feedback</a><br>
                           <a href="images/postererem2.png" target="_blank"> erems poster insp fix</a><br>
                                     <a href="images/postertina.png" target="_blank"> my part on erems poster </a><br>



          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p>It all started where I had given the feedback that there is indeed a lot happening especially at the part where it isnt really needed the most: the team members. It looks a lot like ur main focus goes there and need a cleaner look to improve. I also did not like the straight lines and wanted to turn it into more fresh dynamic feel. 
            Here is how I implimeted that part:<br><br>I first removed all the extra colors around the pictures and added rounded corners the the pics on only one angle. You can see that this sort of allows your eyes to not fully focus on the team first. But eventually this style got voted out and implemted by others' feedback too. Erem continued
            with the feedback until the second poster came out and I had to give immediate feedback about added a title in white and numbers for clarity and clear structure on the 2nd poster . When asked later the teachers said the exact same:</p>
          
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>being part of making the group poster was indeed fun but also a bit overwhelming since everyone has so many ideas on home to implement 
            on something and prefer this being good cuz they made it. I not only gave feedback to Erem's work but also just copied his work and tried improving it 
            from my point of view on the bottom of the page. This makes it still his work with some of my styling on it and i think thats also beautiful.
            It did not get selected tho but surely was in the list to be voted among the group.</p>

          <h3>Timer for catchee</h3>
          <p>I had the task to make a timer on figma for catchee. Now there are various ways you can think of creating when keeping the word "timer" in mind. A digital / traditional clock, maybe a hourglass?</p>
          <a href="images/timerall.png" target="_blank"> timer ss figma</a><br>
          <a href="images/scr1.mov" target="_blank"> screenrecording timer before</a><br>
          <a href="images/scr2.mov" target="_blank"> screenrecording timer after</a><br>
          
          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p>I went firstly with exploring timers on most websites and how the figma experts tend to do it. This was a digital timer where you see the numbers change every second or minute passing by. I practiced a bit on figma by following the tutorials and failed multiple times, especially since when I had to test the prototype the numbers never alligned on time.
            it did get messy and time consuming to fix so I asked around to see what kind of a timer would be preffered for the game: a digital timer or a timer on a line. The most responses said the latter and I started looking for more bar timers, since you can then actually see that the time is up. The tutorials seemed easy to follow untill i understood my part will 
            take a bit longer.
            <br><br>I did make the timer but this time after working on each few seconds passing by to match the speed of the line and minute, I was held by surprise from my group. Their feedback for me was that i made a progressive bar timer where the line moves forward and i should make a regressive bar timer to indicate the time is actually up.
          So i iterated on my work with the follwoing feedback i had received.<br><br>
          To do so you have to animate each little blue move by each second passing which should be calculated with the values of the width in px and the starting number of the blue line also in px. To get till here it took me a while since I first started off with big blue lines going as a stop motion line in 5 seconds. Then I gradually added more components to the point where it began to look like it was moving on its own. I made timers of 1 minute (60 sec); 2 min (120 sec); and 3 min (180 sec) with a total of 360 components</p>
          
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>Very very fun to make. I learnt something new on figma and think everyone should try working with bigger timers like this to geniunely make it look like it smoving on its own. 
            I do agree that it took very long and repetitive to keep myself doing every few seconds, but the end result was very satisfying. The timer was one of the important assets to the game 
            and i'm happy I could make it look like it moves on figma.</p>

          <h3>Background for phonescreen catchee</h3>
          <p>I was given the task to create a background that does not distract the potential users from playing the game, yet ads the cozy sunset campfire vibe with the Cat players.</p>
                    <a href="images/moodboardbg.jpg" target="_blank"> moodboard bg</a><br>

          <a href="images/bg4.jpg" target="_blank"> blurred bg on screen </a><br>

          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p>This was a bit tough to imagine but I already had in mind that I would want the background to get the blurred effect no matter how detailed I am making the background at the moment on the ipad. I don't tend to do digital drawings but I intended on sketching the idea first so I can ask the rest if I should go on with it or not.<br><br>The feedback I got from 
            the majority was that I had taken the task to seriously and should try to zoom in to the picture rather than give a whole scenery. Erem's feedback also was to take inspo from studio ghibli forests/grass.<br><br>
            I iterated on this by starting a new drawing this time emphaszing the forest with the trees, since the cats would be at the front with the campfire, it only makes sense to have the forest as a background where the 
            sky has sunset colors. This was then shown to the group and they immideately loved it.</p>
          
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>I enjoy drawing and digital drawing something wasn't new to me but just a subject that remained untouched untill now. I really got the hang of it after 
            playing around with app to see what brush does what etc. I also do agree that the feedback to make it less complicated over all made the look and feel of the background
            less intense and in a way still added a lot.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="proof">
          <h4>What could go better?</h4>
          <p>Looking back, I could improve by managing my time and scope more realistically, as some of my ideas were too complex for the given timeframe or technical limitations. In order to translate ideas into functional solutions more easily, I also want to gain more confidence in my technical execution using tools like Figma, particularly when prototyping interactions. Lastly, in order to align concepts sooner and prevent revising ideas later in the process, I could speak up earlier in group talks.</p>

I listened to feedback from others about myself and adapted the following weeks and I also had given my feedback and improvement points to my group mates.

          <p> When writing the motivation letters, it was my part to do the one for futurebites, while another team member focused on desca's motivation letter.</p>
           <a href="pdf/Motivation letters projects.docx" target="_blank"> motivation letters doc </a><br>
          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p>Eventually we got exactly futurebites x joinus as our client to make the speedmeet game. My job was to make sure I made it looked polished. I kept pondering and reading the letter out loud to my group until it made sense. Finally I wrote down who we are; our core values and added an expressive tone to the letter. When asked about who's letter stands out more, the teachers told us the one I wrote will "get you a job". That says it all.  </p>
          
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p> this motivation letter made us get the exact client and i feel in a way really good about since i wrote most of it keep the core values in mind. 
            Bold and confident but not overly is the key. I will move on to the next sem with the same mindset. </p>

          <h3>spokesperson with client</h3>
          <p> I took the role of being the communicator with the client regarding anything. This would be mainly before or right after the meetings that were taking place with tour client Jacqueline. </p>
           <a href="images/jaq.png" target="_blank"> talking to client </a><br>
          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p> I was (still am) responsible to have all contact with our client, Jackeline (and Nikkie). I have sent various emails via outlook to reach out to her when this concerend questions she had or the team had for her. I even made sure to plan the dates the team video calls with her for the proper client face to face moment regardless of distance. As a spokesperson I have noticed that I have to articulate words a lot more professional since I want to make it actually look like we are a media agency and not just students. I got into charcter with the starting and ending of the emails too ending with a personal catchee like regards. Also at most emails I have added the coaches and team members so everything remains professionally transparent among all. When contacting Nikkie, this was mainly about organizing what kind of equipment we would need and in what quantity. Later at the event I thanked her for the given opportunity and space. I wanted to leave her with a good impression of us.</p>
          
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p> I would be happy to take a similar role in upcoming group projects because it gave me the opportunity to be responsible with stakeholders and it was a good experinece overall.</p>

          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p>At the STRONGER TOGETHER event everyone had a sat plan according to the event planning. As you can see in this doc I am person E: this role entails to be Recruiter and Phone Lookout. My tasks were to make sure I collect enough partcipants; Walk around and watch the phones and help direct flow to feedback table. But regardless of the event I ended up helping way more than usual. The team expected that the audience we had selected to play would stay all 4 rounds but at about every round some people left a nd therefore I had to look for new participants again. I was partly host as well since the microphone couldn't be managed on time by JoinUs. This led to the host not being clear to the audience, where I had to do the same task as the host aswell. Apart from that since a lot of time was running in finding certain participants, I had to participate as one of the players and have convos with people. In the end I even assembled all the feedback papers. </p>
          
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p> I was an allrounder where I could've panicked from the situation but none the less, I took it like a pro. This teaches me that I should be prepared or atleast know what the tasks of all members are and how you could improvise flawlessly.  </p>

          <h3>ethical considerations</h3>
          <p> Since we know as a team that the project that we are working on is highly sensitive we devided the research work amoung the group. I had to work on the WHY behind the social awkwardness of people.</p>
                        <a href="pdf/Why do people feel social awkwardness.docx" target="_blank"> retrospective doc </a><br>
          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p> I wrote a short document with some points on to why people can have social awkwardness and how it can affect them. I have listed the sources of where I have gotten some of the information from. The conclusion from this document is that there are several factors that can take place in a persons life to have a sort of traumatic response, the social awkwardness. </p>
          
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p> researching this topic made me more aware about who joinus is really trying to make this game for and why social awkwardness really happens. 
            I got more understanding about the topic and could take more decisions into consideration for the sensitvity for the ones who avoid socializing.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="proof">
          <h3>ethical considerations p2</h3>
          <p> another thing we really had to consider was that the concept was that our cat would be roasting a fish on the flame to indicate the timer.
            The question arose if this an ethical approach considering the vegans and vegatarian users that might play the game. </p>

          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p> earlier we didnt think about this question at all but when Jacqueline came up 
            with this question we did think long enough about it until we conducted little interviews asking 
            around some vegans and vegatarian students and teachers wheter or not this would be a deal breaker for them.
            Long story short the answer was no since its logical that cats eat fish and that has nothing to do with the user itself.
            Yet if the answer was otherwise we would consider changing the fish to a marshmallow since its at the campfire.
            Regardless we did have an option for the change in design but luckily the fish wasnt an issue.
          </p>
          
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p> it is always good to ask yourselves these sort of questions to later avoid unneeded misinterpretation of the project you work on 
            when thinking about your target audience you must question around and test if teh design choices you made, no matter how logical or normal it seems,
            These could make someone doubt or feel insecure or any negative vision through our work. I am glad i could work this out by help asking around and fitting to the conclusion 
            for our design.

          <p> I togetehr with Michelle decided to present for the group in loosey goosey's showcase pitch event Lucy's Nest. Here we had to pitch our concept where the judges could probably want to invest in. Think of it a little like Sharktank.</p>
                       <a href="images/looseygoosey.mp4" target="_blank"> loosey goosey presentation video </a><br>


          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p> All the groups of our class were present in the media lab. The both of us had our scripts prepared onour phones and kept revising throughout and then we presnted. While we presented our group took pics/vids and notes from the feedback. My intro went smooth and good but from a certain point I read from the slide since I blanked out on what I had to say. The feedback for the idea was to think of what happens after the players play the game. How do they stay in touch.
          </p>
          
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p> I did feel more nervous than usual since I had to keep to the dark room, heavy lighting and cameras pointed towards me ( I am camera shy). This of course made me stutter and present faster than usual and I fully forgot my script from which I felt the urge to read from the slide. I feel in a way I grasped the opportunity to work on presenting skills, especially infront of cameras, and it did benefit me from avoiding the idea of it in general togetehr with the fact that I was literally pitching to the "sharks".

          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p> When it came to the preparation of the presnetation we were about 2 hours early at the TQ building 
            trying to structure how we are going to present. The presentation slides were done by us as a group in general but 
            when it came to who would talk about what this was discussed last minute. We did howeveer borrowed the pointer from the ISSD on time 
            and also prectised quickly at TQ our positions and tone of voice. I talked about the storytelling aspect of catchee and joinus. 
            In the end the questions were answered by the entire group. <br> <br>
            Since i also dont present in front of such big groups often i felt challenged more than a usual class presntation. I did feel myself getting nervous and anxious but 
            handled myself to take deep breaths and keep a high yet inviting voice towards the audience with eye contact in the middle of the room. I even walked around to calm this down. 
            In a way this did made me more ready to presnt to bigger groups (than just a class). Which is also good for my professional skills: presnting.

          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p> there was a lot missing since we ended up short on time, trying to fix both the code and the presentation while juggling the portfolio 
            on the otherhand. Because of this we planned up the script very last minute and missed out on a lot of thing sto talk about. Maybe we couldve shared statistics
            or more picture. Maybe show my tiktok. But this all by really quick. Since this couldnt happen properly, it looked like we didnt do much in my opinion.

          <h3>16 personality test</h3>
          <p> To figure myself out a bit better I wanted a in depth strenth and weakness analysis. The 16 personality test helped me figure that out better. Here I answered (what resonated to me)  a bunch of general questions. The result I got did not surprise me, since one time I did this test about 2 years ago and I got close to the same personality type. It was INTJ-T (architect), which was also very close to this one. </p>
                     <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/intp-t/f/cf3bz92v5" target="_blank"> result  </a><br>

          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p> This is the "logician" INTP-T type. According to this personality type I am more analytical, innovative and curious about everything and tend to think and judge more than feel. 
            <br> The strengths that I see in myself the most (3 out of 6): <br>-	Adaptability <br>-	Quick to see patterns <br>-	Driven by curiosity <br> <br> The weaknesses that I see in myself the most (3 out of 6): <br>-	Frequent procrastination <br>-	Difficulty completing tasks <br>-	Easily distracted <br> <br>
            I noticed myself adapting quickly to the roles at the event and having that driven feeling when I had to host the event and also talk/pitch about the project. I did get easily distracted by different topics when it came to working in duos on certain documents or figma files which ofcourse also made it difficult completing a task, so to stick back I would mainly ask for help or use trello. I have also mentioned these traits while we discussed in between reflections. 

          </p>
          
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p> I took this into account and read what that page had to say about the personality type and tried to envision myself within that architype too. The career path seems correct too so I know that it did close to accurately represnted my personality. I figured to give myself a mini test to see where all I can combat my weaknesses and promote my strengths. This mainly took place during the 15 weeks of the group project
            and to be very honest with myself the test helped me figure myself out in way even within this semesters projects and team work.

        <div class="proof">
          <h3>retrospectives</h3>
          <p>After every sprint, just like how the trello stated, the team would have a collaborated retrospective together. This is of course to keep track of how the sprint went and what could go better and self reflect. Partcipating in this means truthfully accepting your faults and acknowledging to the group and also respectfully giving feedback to others. </p>

          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p> I have actively particpated in these reflections where I have mentioned things about myself, ive accepted what feedback I would get from my team mates and also ponder on to that. But eventually I did work on them, every sprint I got better and kept asking to make sure 
            I do not repeat the same mistakes.  After all I want to improve on my professional skills that lso involves collaboration and better workflow. In the start Michelle mainly took notes but later we got feedback from dirk to do this in forms of sticky notes, where everyone 
            sticks their opinionated notes at the same time and we have a total overview and talk about these subjects.  I found this method a lot more efficient, but this did take us longer to talk about.
          </p>
          
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p> I know that being reflective about the process is equally important as working on the project, if not, even more imporant. 
            The idea is to grow from the feedback you get from your peers and increase team performance within the timespan of the project. If anything i just grew more from the feedback i got this semseter.

          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p> Together with Nikki we managed to get almost all the equipment except for a mic. This was to ensure all participants could listen to the host (michelle) clearly. I feel this is where our team felt a bit lost and things were messing up a bit.  I was not only doing my task, which was to actively collect people around to play, checking on their phones and bringing all the feedback papers to the feedback table BUT together with that it bothered me how half of the participants couldn't hear michelle since she is a rather soft spoken person and the mic felt missing. I stepped in to also host and at most rounds, so that there was enough explanation on both sides and  I was also a participant during some rounds to ensure enough players. 
          </p>
          
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p> I know that this came from self instinct and quick response to help the team as quick as possible, which is good for playing fair in the team when needed. I also realized that most of my teammates didn't dare to devide their role even just for a bit, so in a way I felt I was managing many tasks together and keeping it under control. This is a strong skill not many people have and I want to keep developing it, since work life can also be unpredictable as the event without the mic.

          <h3>tiktok: my new skill?</h3>
          <p>During the STRONGER TOGETHER event from JoinUs, me and my team had to make sure we were there way before time in Amersfoort. The moment of arrival, we started setting up the tools and double checking to test and see if everything is still alright. When this all was taking place I found myself taking some short videos of the process, even the lunch break we got, and decided "why not just make a funny tiktok edit??". </p>

          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p> I usually don't use tiktok much but learning how to work with can be beneficial when it comes to general marketing or building e certain audience. Of course over time this little goofy idea can turn into something populaire overnight. I did not think that far when editing but I made 2 funny videos ( one bts vid  and one group members vid) with some trending audios, cuz why not? Earlier I did not know how to edit them shorter but with a quick youtube tutorial I got the hang of it and added some sparkly effects in between too! 
          </p>
          
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p> Looking at the humorous videos i do see potential in seriously getting into content creation which could be eithe rinstagram or tiktok. 
            Even though this was just for fun and laughs, I could turn this into something big if i in the future continue giving more time to it. 
            Whether this be for humour or something with a serious topic but hey who knows.

          <h3>Portfolio inspiration</h3>
          <p>
            It did not take me long coming up with portfolio design ideas since most of it went pretty smooth. The inspo I took was mainly from where I work: Rituals. One of my favorite body care products is now the inspiration to my portfolio design choice: the Ritual of Amsterdam. I was greatly inspired by the mix of the two cultures (Japanese and Dutch) and the similar color usage for both the east and the west. I took more inspo from Pinterest to make moodboards and stylescapes right away. This gave me better insight on whether I should focus on the Japanese side or the Dutch side more. I want an equal mix of both but I do like introducing my webpage with an ink drawn dragon so that will start off Japanese but end up with Dutch like visuals.
          </p>
          
          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p>
            I am not sure if I would like a website/page or more of a booklet with a QR scanner leading to a complete document. I gathered my inspiration from Rituals' Ritual of Amsterdam collection, which beautifully blends Eastern and Western aesthetics. This cultural fusion resonated with me and became the foundation for my portfolio's visual identity. I created moodboards exploring both cultural elements, looking at traditional Japanese ink art, Dutch architectural styles, and how they could harmoniously coexist in a digital space.
          </p>
          
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>
            This process of finding inspiration from my everyday work environment taught me to look for design opportunities in unexpected places. The cultural blend concept not only makes my portfolio unique but also reflects my ability to merge different design philosophies into a cohesive experience. It's a reminder that inspiration can come from anywhere - even the products we use daily.

          <h3>Concepting webpage ideas in Figma</h3>
          <p>
            Deciding whether I want to do a webpage or not had me feeling to just start on something rather than nothing. Since the theme I am going for has half Dutch and half Japanese roots, I want to make something that you notice right away from those origins as well. Think of the bento boxes from Japan: these are school/work boxes made in different grid-like forms in which each little portion of food goes inside. The same way there has been a rise in the 2025 trends that the bento grid webpage has been very known for its simplistic yet unique design choices.
          </p>
          
          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p>
            In the Figma screenshots you can see what I am trying to go for in the homepage. For now I don't like the way the other pages look but when it comes to function of each layout, it does make sense. I have added the similar tones of blues and looked at what fonts could look nice until I got to the result you see. The bento grid layout allows me to organize content in a visually interesting way while maintaining the cultural aesthetic I'm aiming for. Each "box" in the grid can tell a different part of my story, much like the different compartments in a bento box serve different purposes.
          </p>
          
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>
            The bento grid concept is a perfect metaphor for my portfolio structure - organized sections that come together to form a complete picture. I will need to iterate on the inner pages later, but the foundation is strong. This approach taught me how to connect design trends with cultural inspiration to create something meaningful. The challenge now is maintaining consistency across all pages while keeping each section distinct and interesting.

          <h3>Personal Trello</h3>
          <p>
            To make sure I don't slack on my work and to save all progress of the days, weeks and/or months I wanted to make a personal Trello where I could clearly see what learning outcomes had more or less documentation and what needed more work. This data gets stored in the Trello precisely and shows me how much progress I am making.
          </p>
          
          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p>
            I organized my Trello board with columns for each learning outcome, and within each column I added cards for different pieces of evidence. I used labels to indicate priority levels and deadlines. This visual organization helped me see at a glance which areas needed more attention and which were well-documented. I also added a "To Review" column where I could place items that needed refinement or additional reflection.
          </p>
          
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>
            Using a personal Trello board has been invaluable for managing my portfolio development. It's transformed what could have been an overwhelming task into manageable chunks. The visual nature of Trello makes it easy to see progress, which is motivating. I can also track how my time is distributed across different learning outcomes and adjust accordingly. This self-management tool has improved my organizational skills and time management.

        <div class="proof">
          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            Based on the ritual of Amsterdam I really wanted to create something simple yet interactive. I was also really intrigued by the bento grid style website but otherwise my plan was to probably make a sort of booklet which didn't really work out for me.

            I started off by sketching my work on paper and wanted to go further with that on figma. Here you can see me trying different styles. In the low prototypes (all grey) I made sure to ask Michelle Lit to user test this.

          <p>It looks like a website portfolio for student.</p>
          
          <h4>2. "What did you look at first?"</h4>
          <p>All the blocks. They look interesting. Kind of like the bento grid trend.</p>

            Based on this I went on and fixed a few more changes like for example I didn't keep the original border lines and tried keeping the boxes only. I even completely removed the idea of how I was thinking of creating my lo page. Then I made way too many versions of my homepage and asked Daniel Willems with user testing what he thinks is better.

            I agreed with Daniël and eventually did add more icons relating how rituals tends to see itself but also adding the delft blue aesthetics matching to the project each. I kept it this way.

          <p>
            Due to time constraints I felt like I did lack on doing more user tests but I am really happy with the way my portfolios design turned out to be. If there's one thing I would like to add is maybe start on time and don't get too stuck with choosing what I will present more on how I will present.

          <p>
            A friend of mine studying hotel management reached out to me since she recalled that I do ICT media and wanted to pursue more UX/UI related career opportunities. She needed some help with a thesis project where an interview was needed for UX/UI related questions and understanding their client's app while sharing more of my expertise. I was more than happy to participate in this. This interview had 2 parts since the first half cut off through unstable wifi. Regardless, this lasted around 40 minutes.

            The interview covered various aspects of UX/UI design, including my design process, how I approach user research, my thoughts on accessibility, and how I balance aesthetic choices with functionality. We discussed specific projects I've worked on and the design decisions behind them. The conversation also touched on trends in UX/UI design and how they influence my work. She is yet to transcribe the interview, which I'll add to my portfolio once available.

          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>
            To me I wasn't really expecting to get interviewed about this any time soon, but I took the opportunity since it is quite rare to talk about my knowledge in UX/UI. I felt confident explaining my design perspective and user-centric talks. I not only enjoyed explaining what I learned but also teaching someone about it. It made me realize how much tacit knowledge I've developed that I don't always articulate. The experience boosted my confidence in my professional expertise and communication skills.

          <h3>Typewear at Tech Campus</h3>
          <p>
            I insisted to help one of my peers, Jordi Coll, who happens to be a software content creator on Instagram. I came across his video and I saw that he was looking for some help for someone to film his videos while he would test out the first wearable mouse and keyboard: Typewear. After hearing what it was about and how this could be an exciting way to introduce this on video, I insisted on helping with the filming. I met him and the developer of the Typewear at 3eality Tech Campus, where he explained how long it took him to make this and how the process went.
          </p>
          
          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p>
            The Typewear was actually a prototype in progress but ready to test. I was curious and asked about the design stages and thoughts behind the product. After an overload of information, I had a great time at 3eality Tech Campus while even helping a content creator. It took multiple tries and different angles too. One thing I did notice was that Jordi did not properly prepare his script. He didn't know what he wanted to talk about for the Typewear video and got a bit stuck, that is where I jumped in and helped with scripting. I also gave him feedback for next time.
          </p>
          
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>
            Regardless, I really liked the filming reels idea - for sure something I have thought to do some time in the near future. This experience taught me about the intersection of product design and content creation. Helping with the scripting showed me how important preparation is for professional content, and how design thinking can be applied even to video production. It was fascinating to see a hardware prototype in action and learn about the UX challenges in wearable technology.

            I wanted to make sure that I have an opportunity for the coming semesters. By that I mean getting an internship at Rituals as either a product designer or a web designer. Why at Rituals? Because this is currently where I work part-time and I enjoy their constant work on new limited editions. Their website isn't boring and I love their products too.
          </p>
          
          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p>
            I personally asked the managers on how to get there since it is pretty rare for them to give internships for those positions and my constant research on this topic has been ongoing too. Since September they've added a new limited edition to the collection and ever since their website added this interactive 3D site specifically for the limited edition. I keep on the lookout for it. I've been analyzing their website updates, studying their design language, and noting how they integrate their brand identity across digital platforms.

            This proactive approach to career development shows my genuine interest in the company and the field. By working there part-time while studying their digital presence, I'm getting a holistic understanding of the brand. This research will be valuable whether I end up interning there or not - I'm learning how successful brands maintain consistency and innovation in their digital experiences. It's also teaching me how to spot opportunities and position myself for them professionally.

          <h3>Utrecht HBO-ICT Student event</h3>
          <p>
            One of my friends from sem 4 media forwarded information about the HBO ICT event to me and asked if I was interested to go. That day was a regular school day but I decided to let my group know in advance and went ahead to Utrecht. I wanted to get out of my comfort zone, meet more people in the ICT world and talk to possible companies for my future internship.

          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p>
            There was a talk about the future of all ICT students and AI. They reassured us that our jobs won't be taken from us (as long as we work with AI too). After that there were a lot of market stalls where the main talking and connection making was happening. I took flyers from very few companies since the majority had the focus on software and backend ICT students. Apart from that I participated in guessing how much candy in a jar and won a suitcase and gameboy from "Sogeti" - they work with chatgemini and also had focus on women in STEM.
          </p>
          
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>
            Overall I left Utrecht with not only a good time but also a lot of new faces with bright minds and a blue suitcase. I hope to go to more events like this in the future. This event pushed me to network actively, which is not always comfortable for me. I learned that professional networking doesn't have to be intimidating - it can be about genuine conversations with people who share similar interests and challenges. The experience reinforced the importance of staying updated on industry trends, especially regarding AI's impact on our field.

            While scrolling through LinkedIn on my phone I thought to myself, "there should be some kind of event for young professionals around here in Eindhoven, maybe generally in the Netherlands, for ICT students." This was the case but mainly I questioned if there was anything more for women in tech. After a couple of searches I found HerFuture.

          <h4>What HerFuture is</h4>
          <p>
            HerFuture is an online and offline community and platform dedicated to supporting and empowering female students, graduates, and young professionals in their technology and STEM careers. The name combines "Her," representing women, with "Future," indicating its goal to advance their careers.
          </p>
          
          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p>
            I got excited and dived deeper into their social media pages and events. Turns out they had events all over the Netherlands and I signed up right away for the event in Eindhoven, hoping to get picked (this works on first come first serve) and I did! This took place on the 28th of October where I joined the "career dinner" with ambitious women in STEM.
          </p>
          
          <h4>Update & Reflection</h4>
          <p>
            I do not regret signing up for this event. The dinner was such an eye opener, especially with such inspiring conversations with female role models from companies like VDL groep, Royal SMIT Transformers and Kasparov Finance & BI. The night was packed with opportunities to learn, laugh and grow. I also exchanged LinkedIn connections with some of the women in STEM there. There was a three-course meal, a CV workshop and good vibes. Truly a reminder of how powerful a community and networking can be. I have enrolled myself as a member of HerFuture for future events.
          </p>
          <p>
            This experience was invaluable for my professional development. Being surrounded by successful women in tech showed me the possibilities and paths available in my field. The CV workshop gave me practical skills, and the networking opportunities were genuine and supportive rather than competitive. This is the kind of community I want to stay connected with throughout my career.

          <p>
            I had gotten the email on Outlook that it will be soon time to choose the path for the next semester. I did not know at all what I really wanted and felt so lost with overweighing the sides of "game design", "smart mobile" and/or "front end". I had conversations with several teachers where they eventually advised me to try out career day at TQ.
          </p>
          
          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p>
            I went to the career day at TQ following the advice and saw many companies. I listened to their stories, their wants and needs and what specific thing they look for. Most companies were looking for interns but I wanted to make sure that I answer my own questions. What really convinced me was when I went to the stand of game design and saw a game that one of the students made - the game's name was Dogfight from their very own game studio where they made 2 teachers battle each other. To me this was amusing but also so cool. The fact that it is creative and is functioning, letting both characters add value and bring the game to life. I enjoyed listening to the process of the game as well and asked the student various questions relating to the learning outcomes in the semester and how long certain projects would take.
          </p>
          
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>
            I did look around afterwards but the only thing that stuck to me clearly was game design. This way career day helped me form my decision for choosing game design for sem 4 and I am really looking forward to it! This decision-making process taught me to seek out information actively and trust my instincts. Seeing the actual work produced by students in different specializations was far more helpful than just reading descriptions. I'm excited about game design because it combines so many elements I enjoy: storytelling, visual design, user experience, and technical implementation. It feels like the right challenge for my next step.

          <h3>Discipline Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            I had been feeling really lazy and demotivated about a lot of things, starting off mainly from the way I physically look. My body has, for a while now, been my insecurity and I hadn't done anything about it. I noticed that this mindset also had consequences with the work I do for school or even at my job. Who knows if this goes on longer I do this to my future ICT job as well? That would not look good. I kept telling myself, "I will do it tomorrow" and never get things done. I wanted a change and I wanted it instantly.
          </p>
          
          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p>
            So I came up with an idea. I signed a contract with Tevin Sanchez (in the other media class) to lose 15 kgs by 15 December. We bet on money since this would keep us a lot more motivated as the broke students we are. So far I am not close to 15kgs but with my consistent diet and everyday movement and workouts I managed to lose 6kgs (17th Dec 2024) and I am proud of myself for not giving up and "leaving it for some other time."
          </p>
          
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>
            I know once the given date is gone, the winner or the loser is determined, but in that meantime I have been building a habit and I see it in the way I eat, sleep, work, study etc. There is a lot of room for improvement but even if it's 1% improvement per day, I know I am growing, both physically and mentally.
          </p>
          <p>
            This challenge has taught me so much about personal development and discipline. The physical transformation is just one part - what's more valuable is how I've learned to set goals, stay accountable, and push through resistance. The discipline I'm building in my personal life is directly transferring to my work ethic. I'm more consistent with deadlines, more persistent when facing technical challenges, and better at managing my time. This experience has shown me that personal growth and professional growth are interconnected - improving one area positively impacts others. The mindset shift from "I'll do it tomorrow" to "I'll do it now" is something I can apply to every aspect of my life, including my career in ICT.

          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            In my free time I wanted to make this extra project: the interactive bikini bottom map since I'm a huge fan of SpongeBob and also want to always experiment making some kind of fun project relating that. Let's see where it all started.

        <div class="proof">
          <h3>Concept process</h3>
          <p>
            Here the idea I had was to first go through all SpongeBob references and collect ideas in general. This was through Pinterest and Reddit. I then noted down some ideas as a brainstorming part of the project. This was to see into what I really wanted to achieve and get with my designing and development skills.

          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p>
            As you can see I thought of 3 different things: Bikini bottom interactive map; krusty krab order simulator; bikini bottom citizen quiz. After thinking about it I voted on the 2 most preferred then finally I chose one and that was the map.
          </p>
          <p>
            From here I started thinking more and more on the map. What features to add, the locations, the colors etc. I then went on to Pinterest and Reddit to get an idea of the whole map of bikini bottom and these were accurate. These are to help ideate the whole map and see what I can put on the specific locations too. My idea to create a map of bikini bottom.

          <h3>Sketching bikini bottom map</h3>
          <p>
            Here I just wanted to bring the concept to life by creating a visual with the help of a quick marker sketch.
          </p>
          <a href="images/mappo.JPG">View my sketch</a>
          
          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p>
            Since I already had my inspo ready I wanted to create a sketch where I see exactly what I can put where. The location isn't as accurate as the maps of bikini bottom online but it's a rough estimate on how the page could look on first glance. Here's the sketch.
          </p>
          <p>
            When asked to the people of my class who are familiar with SpongeBob, they could sort of pin point where most of the locations are at, I then wrote down all the locations later with arrows.

          <h3>Project Documentation</h3>
          <p><strong>Project Title:</strong> Interactive Bikini Bottom Map</p>
          
          <h4>Project Description</h4>
          <p>
            This project started off as an extra project where it's described as an interactive web-based map inspired by the fictional city of Bikini Bottom. The goal was to create an engaging digital experience where users can explore iconic locations from the SpongeBob universe through clickable interactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            P.S: the project did could not be finished on time since there was an issue regarding time constraint.

          <h3>Concept & Target Audience</h3>
          <p>
            The target audience consists of teenagers and fans of animated media. The design focuses on playfulness, clarity, and intuitive navigation, ensuring users immediately understand where they can interact.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="proof">
          <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
          <p>What inspired me for The UI design by the cartoon itself:</p>
          <p>
            - Bright, saturated colors to reflect the underwater theme<br>
            - Spongebob typography for a friendly tone<br>
            - Consistent visual hierarchy across popups<br>
            Further up could use animations for floating jellyfish.
          </p>
          
          <h4>Extras:</h4>
          <p>
            - elements must be interactive, think of hover or pop up card<br>
            - Clickable<br>
            - Noises and sounds similar to the one in SpongeBob cartoon<br>
            - Background music
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="proof">
          <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
          <p>
            - HTML would be used for semantic structure and accessibility<br>
            - CSS would handle layout, positioning, animations, and responsive design<br>
            - JavaScript could enable interactive functionality such as click events, dynamic content updates, and modal control
          </p>
          <p>
            The JavaScript logic would be kept modular and readable to ensure maintainability.

          <h3>Game idea</h3>
          <p>
            This idea was not just for fun but In reality I thought to make it into a game to practice my concepting and coding for game design, which I've chosen as the next study interest for the semester. That's why the interactive map idea. It has a (already existing) storyline, sound, characters etc. So this was to test that and see what I'd think of it.

          <h3>General Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            Of course besides the fact that isn't done on time to showcase the whole idea on reflecting the project was to demonstrate the integration of UX/UI design and frontend development to show how this digital combination can create a engaging digital experience. I enjoyed creating the the concept and thinking of this as a passion project for the next semester. Since I wanted a game like element into this and I'm going into game design I really wanted to push through and see if I could try and make it.
