      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Me and my group of 5 others made a media agency where we play 
        temporary roles of ux/ui designers who take the roles seriously 
        and have stakeholders whom we work for. The project given by our 
        client is a digital speed meet game to let young adults who struggle 
        socially to make friends/talk to people. In this document I walk you
        what were the efforts I put in together with my team per learning outcome.
